          <h4>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</h4>
          <h4>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng"

          <p class = "description">
            The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints really uses the
            principle of proximity for their webesite. They place articles and
            talks next to each other that all relate to Jesus Christ. They use
            proximity to teach people that the purpose of the church is to bring
            people close to Christ.

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <div class="main">
          <h4>Verizon</h4>
          <h4><a href="https://www.verizon.com/">verizon.com</a></h4>
          <img src="images/contrast.png" alt="Verizon Website" />
          <p class = "description">
            Verizon uses the principle contrast to emphasize what they have to
            offer. You can see that the background is a pitch black with white
            lettering. This helps users focus go right where Verizon wants to.
            With contrast they say their message loud and clear and make an
            instant impact on the reader.

        <h3>Allignment</h3>
        <div class="main">
          <h4>Apple</h4>
          <h4><a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a></h4>
          <img src="images/allignment.png" alt="Apple website" />
          <p class = "description">
            The apple website has a very sleek design that uses allignment very
            effectively. The website has everything down to headings,images, and
            links alligned making the website very pleasing to look at. Another
            thing they do very well that is not mentioned above is the user
            interface.
